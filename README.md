# Harmony Codebase Expansion

This project is an expansion of a Global Game Jam 2022 game called Harmony. I added the ability to save and load the positions of the two players as well as the collected collectibles by utilizing Firebase.


## Implementation

- Unity Game Engine
- Firebase for saving and loading
